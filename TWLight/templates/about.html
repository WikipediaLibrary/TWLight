      The Wikipedia Library Card Platform is our central tool for reviewing applications and providing access to those partner resources. Here you can see which partnerships are available, what kinds of materials each database provides, and apply for the ones you want. Volunteer coordinators, who have signed non-disclosure agreements with the Wikimedia Foundation, review applications and work with partners to get you your free access.

      Any active editor in good standing can receive access.  Applications are reviewed based on the editor’s need and contributions. If you think you could use access to one of our partner resources and are an active editor in any project supported by the Wikimedia Foundation, please apply.

      If you don't quite meet the experience requirements but think you would still be a strong candidate for access, feel free to apply and you may still be considered.

  <h3>Citation practices</h3>

  <p>
    {# Translators: the gunk with ampersands is HTML for <code>|via=</code> and <code>{{subscription required|via=}}</code> . It needs to use the HTML gunk rather than the normal characters for technical reasons. You should leave the gunk alone, but translate '|via' and 'subscription required|via=' if other tags are used for your language Wikipedia. If you're not sure how to handle this section, take your best guess and give the developer a heads-up. #}
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
      Citation practices vary by project and even by article.  Generally, we support editors citing where they found information, in a form that allows others to check it for themselves.  That often means providing both original source details as well as a link to the partner database in which the source was found.

    This section probably does not need to be translated - a look around at a
    few non-English wikis suggests that titles, journal titles, etc. retain
    their original language.
