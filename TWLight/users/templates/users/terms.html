Access to resources via The Wikipedia Library is reserved for community members who have demonstrated their commitment to the Wikimedia projects, and who will use their access to these resources to improve project content. To that end, in order to be eligible for The Wikipedia Library, we require that you be registered for a user account on the projects, with at least 500 edits, six (6) months of activity, and 10+ edits in the last month. We ask that you do not request access to any publishers with a limited number of available accounts whose resources you can already access for free through your local library or university, or another institution or organization, in order to provide that opportunity to others.
