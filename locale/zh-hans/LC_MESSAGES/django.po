"accessed as before.</p> <p>Until now, all access via The Wikipedia Library "
"required that you apply to and be approved for individual collections. The "
"Library Bundle changes that workflow by making some collections immediately "
"available to everyone who meets the experience requirements outlined in our "
"Terms of Use. As long as you continue to meet those requirements (which "
"include 10 edits within the past month and not being blocked), you will have "

"enable cookies. If you are having problems you should also try clearing your "
"cache and restarting your browser. Please be aware that existing individual "
"logins for EZProxy-enabled collections (including the Library Bundle) will "
"soon be deactivated, so this will be your only means of access for these "
