            The Wikipedia Library is an open research hub, through which active Wikipedia editors can gain both access to the vital reliable sources needed for their work and support in using those resources to improve the encyclopedia. We have partnered with publishers around the world to allow users to freely access otherwise paywalled resources. This platform allows users to apply simultaneously for access to multiple publishers, and makes the administration of Wikipedia Library accounts easy and efficient.

            These terms pertain to your application for access to Wikipedia Library resources, and your use of those resources. They also describe our handling of the information you provide to us in order to create and administer your Wikipedia Library account. The Wikipedia Library system is evolving, and over time we may update these terms due to changes in the technology. We recommend that you review the terms from time to time. If we make substantial changes to the terms, we will send a notification email to Wikipedia Library users.

            As a preliminary note, Wikipedia Library accounts are reserved for community members who have demonstrated their commitment to the Wikimedia projects, and will use their access to these resources to improve project content. To that end, in order to be eligible for the Wikipedia Library program, we require that you be registered for a user account on the projects. We generally give preference to users with at least 500 edits and six (6) months of activity, but these are not strict requirements. You must have the Special:EmailUser feature enabled on at least one version of Wikipedia, and you will identify that as your "home" wiki when you create an account. We ask that you do not request access to any publishers whose resources you can already access for free through your local library or university, or another institution or organization, in order to provide that opportunity to others.

            Additionally, if you are currently blocked or banned from a Wikimedia project, you may be rejected when you apply for a Wikipedia Library account. If you obtain a Wikipedia Library account, but a long-term block or ban is subsequently instituted against you on one of the projects, you may lose access to your Wikipedia Library account.

            In order to apply for a Wikipedia Library Card account, you must provide us with certain information, which we will use to evaluate your application. If your application is approved, we may transfer the information you have given us to the publishers whose resources you wish to access. The publisher will then create a free account for you. In most cases, they will contact you with the account information directly, although sometimes we will send access information to you ourselves.

            Each publisher who is a member of the Wikipedia Library program requires different specific information in the application. Some publishers may request only an email address, while others request more detailed data, such as your name, location, occupation, or institutional affiliation. When you complete your application, you will only be asked to supply information required by the publishers you have chosen, and each publisher will only receive the information they require. Please see our <a href="{{ partners_page }}">partner information pages</a> to learn what information is required by each publisher to gain access to their resources.
