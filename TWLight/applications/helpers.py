"""
Information comes in three types:
1) Information required for all access grants. (Example: wikipedia username)
2) Information that only some partners require, but which will be the same for
   all partners in any given application. (Example: country of residence)
3) Information that only some partners require, and that may differ for
   different partners. (Example: rationale for resource request)

These facts about required/optional status are used to generate application
forms. In particular, we can generate application forms which impose the
smallest possible data entry burden on users by:
* omitting optional fields if they aren't required by any of the requested
  partners;
* asking for optional information only once per application, rather than once
  per partner, if it will be the same for all partners.

Facts related to this file are hardcoded in three other places in the database:

1) In TWLight.resources.models.Partner, which tracks whether a given partner
   requires the optional information;
2) In TWLight.applications.forms.Application, which has fields for all
   possible partner-specific information (though any given application instance
   may leave optional fields blank).
3) In TWLight.users.models.Editor, which records user data.

Why this hardcoding? Well, having defined database models lets us take advantage
of an awful lot of Django machinery. Also, dynamically generating everything on
the fly might be slow and lead to hard-to-read code.

applications.tests checks to make sure that these three sources are in agreement
about the optional data fields available: both their names and their types. It
also checks that the constructed application form fields match those types.
