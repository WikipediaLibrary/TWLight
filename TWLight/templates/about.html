      The Wikipedia Library Card Platform is our central tool for reviewing applications and providing access to our
      collection. Here you can see which partnerships are available, search their contents, and apply for and access
      the ones you’re interested in. Volunteer coordinators, who have signed non-disclosure agreements with the
      Wikimedia Foundation, review applications and work with publishers to get you your free access.
      Some content is available without an application.

      Any active editor in good standing can receive access. For publishers with limited numbers of accounts,
      applications are reviewed based on the editor’s needs and contributions. If you think you could use access to one
      of our partner resources and are an active editor in any project supported by the Wikimedia Foundation, please
      apply.

        If your account is blocked on one or more Wikimedia projects, you may still
        be granted access to The Wikipedia Library. You will need to contact the
        Wikipedia Library team, who will review your blocks. If you have been blocked
        for content issues, most notably copyright violations, or have multiple
        long-term blocks, we may decline your request. Additionally, if your block
        status changes after being approved, you will need to request another review.

      EZProxy is a proxy server used to authenticate users for many Wikipedia Library partners. Users sign into EZProxy
      via the Library Card platform to verify that they are authorized users, and then the server accesses requested
      resources using its own IP address.

      You may notice that when accessing resources via EZProxy that URLs are dynamically rewritten. This is why we
      recommend logging in via the Library Card platform rather than going directly to the unproxied partner website.
      When in doubt, check the URL for ‘idm.oclc’. If it’s there, then you’re connected via EZProxy.

      Typically once you’ve logged in your session will remain active in your browser for up to two hours after you’ve
      finished searching. Note that use of EZProxy requires you to enable cookies. If you are having problems you
      should also try clearing your cache and restarting your browser.

      The Library Bundle is a collection of resources for which no application is required. If you meet the
      criteria laid out above, you will be authorized for access automatically upon logging in to the platform. Only
      some of our content is currently included in the Library Bundle, however we hope to expand the collection as
      more publishers become comfortable with participating. All Bundle content is accessed via EZProxy.

      Citation practices vary by project and even by article. Generally, we support editors citing where they found
      information, in a form that allows others to check it for themselves. That often means providing both original
      source details as well as a link to the partner database in which the source was found.
