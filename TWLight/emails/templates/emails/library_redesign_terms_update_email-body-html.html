      <p>Hi,</p>

      <p>
        You are receiving this email because you have an account with The Wikipedia Library
        (<a href="https://wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org/">https://wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org/</a>).
        We are emailing to notify you that we have updated the text of our Terms of Use.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have updated the wording of the Terms of Use primarily to make a small change
        to who is eligible to use the library. Alongside the recent deployment of a new
        user interface (<a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Library_Card_platform/Design_improvements">https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Library_Card_platform/Design_improvements</a>),
        we are going to be enforcing eligibility requirements for the library more consistently.
        Users who donâ€™t quite meet the requirements will no longer be able to file applications
        for access to collections and must wait until they meet the criteria in full before
        they can use the library. We hope this change will make access more consistent,
        and reduce the workload generated by applications from editors who are far below
        the activity requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
        As part of this update we have also taken the opportunity to clarify and reword
        some areas of the Terms of Use which were unclear or outdated. A full list of the
        changes can be found at <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T285760">https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T285760</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you no longer wish to use the library, you can delete your account by clicking
        the Delete button in the Data section of your user page:
        <a href="https://wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org/users/">https://wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org/users/</a>
      </p>

      <p>Thanks,</p>

      <p>The Wikipedia Library team</p>
