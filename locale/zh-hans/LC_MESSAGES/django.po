#. Translators: the gunk with ampersands is HTML for <code>|via=</code> and <code>{{subscription required|via=}}</code> . It needs to use the HTML gunk rather than the normal characters for technical reasons. You should leave the gunk alone, but translate '|via' and 'subscription required|via=' if other tags are used for your language Wikipedia. If you're not sure how to handle this section, take your best guess and give the developer a heads-up.
