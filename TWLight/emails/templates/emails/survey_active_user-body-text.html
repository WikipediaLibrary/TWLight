Hi,

We are currently running a survey to understand how editors use
The Wikipedia Library. According to our records, you have logged in to
The Wikipedia Library at least once, so we would love to hear from you!

{{ link }}

We really appreciate your feedback - this survey will help us understand how
The Wikipedia Library is currently being used, and where it could use
improvement. Your responses will directly impact how the Wikimedia Foundation
prioritises technical and partnership work for this project.

The survey should take 5-10 minutes to complete.

If you would like to opt-out of being contacted with future Wikipedia Library
surveys, please let us know by emailing wikipedialibrary@wikimedia.org and we
will remove you from any future mailing.

Thanks,

The Wikipedia Library team
