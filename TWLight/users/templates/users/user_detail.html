      Hi, {{ username }}! You don't have a Wikipedia editor profile attached
      to your account here, so you are probably a site administrator.

      If you aren't a site administrator, something weird has happened. You
      won't be able to apply for access without a Wikipedia editor profile.
      You should log out and create a new account by logging in via OAuth,
      or contact a site administrator for help.
