Vă rugăm să rețineți că datele de conectare individuale existente pentru colecțiile activate cu EZProxy (inclusiv pachetul de bibliotecă) vor fi în curând dezactivate, astfel că acesta va fi singurul dvs. mijloc de acces pentru aceste colecții.

msgstr "Salut %(username)s, Biblioteca Wikipedia are plăcerea de a anunța implementarea accesului EZProxy și a pachetului de bibliotecă! EZProxy este un server proxy utilizat pentru a vă autentifica accesul. În loc să gestionați autentificări individuale pentru fiecare colecție la care ați fost aprobat, puteți accesa acum tot conținutul acceptat de EZProxy, pur și simplu conectându-vă la contul dvs. Card de bibliotecă și făcând click pe site-ul web. Pentru a accesa colecțiile EZProxy, pur și simplu accesați Platforma Card a Bibliotecii, accesați pagina Biblioteca mea la https://wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org/users/my_library și faceți click pe 'Accesați colecția' pentru conținutul pe care doriți să îl accesați sub fila 'Acces instantaneu'. Dacă aveți conturi active până acum, vă rugăm să vă luați timp pentru a examina pagina Biblioteca mea pentru a verifica modul în care trebuie să accesați aceste conturi înainte. Colecțiile din fila 'Acces instantaneu' trebuie accesate acum prin EZProxy. Colecțiile din fila 'Acces individual' ar trebui accesate ca înainte. Până acum, toate accesele prin intermediul Bibliotecii Wikipedia au solicitat să solicitați și să fiți aprobat pentru colecții individuale. Pachetul de biblioteci modifică fluxul de lucru, punând imediat la dispoziție tuturor colecțiilor tuturor celor care îndeplinesc cerințele de experiență prezentate în Termenii de utilizare. Atâta timp cât veți continua să îndepliniți aceste cerințe (care includ 10 modificări în ultima lună și să nu fiți blocat), veți avea acces la cerere la colecțiile Bundle Library prin intermediul Cardului de bibliotecă, fără a fi necesar să faceți o cerere sau o cerere de reînnoire. Puteți verifica dacă îndepliniți criteriile pentru a accesa colecțiile pachetului de bibliotecă pe pagina de pornire a cardului de bibliotecă - https://wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org. Dacă sunteți eligibil, colecțiile vor fi accesibile prin fila 'Acces instantaneu' din Biblioteca mea. Este posibil să observați când accesați resurse prin EZProxy că adresele URL sunt rescrise dinamic. Rețineți că utilizarea EZProxy necesită activarea cookie-urilor. Dacă aveți probleme, trebuie să încercați, de asemenea, să vă ștergeți memoria cache și să reporniți browserul. Vă rugăm să rețineți că autentificările individuale existente pentru colecțiile activate EZProxy (inclusiv pachetul de bibliotecă) vor fi în curând dezactivate, astfel că acesta va fi singurul dvs. mijloc de acces pentru aceste colecții. Toate colecțiile din fila 'Acces individual' din Biblioteca mea vor funcționa ca înainte. Alături de lansarea acestor noi metode de acces, suntem fericiți să anunțăm mai multe parteneriate noi mari, inclusiv colecții multidisciplinare mari de la Springer Nature și ProQuest. Puteți citi mai multe lahttps://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Library_Card_platform/Authentication-based_access. Dacă aveți întrebări, vă rugăm să postați pe pagina de discuții. Cele bune, Echipa Biblioteca Wikipedia"
