"<p>Hi %(username)s,</p> <p>The Wikipedia Library is pleased to announce the "

"proxy server used to authenticate your access. Instead of managing "
"individual logins for each collection to which you have been approved, you "
"can now access all EZProxy-supported content simply by logging in to your "
"Library Card account and clicking through to the website. To access EZProxy "
"collections, simply visit the Library Card platform, go to the My Library "
"page at https://wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org/users/my_library, and click on "
"‘Access collection’ for the content you wish to access under the ‘Instant "
"access’ tab.</p> <p>If you had active accounts before now, please take the "
"time to review the My Library page to verify how you need to access those "
"accounts going forward. Collections in the 'Instant Access' tab must now be "
"accessed via EZProxy. Collections in the 'Individual Access' tab should be "
"accessed as before.</p> <p>Until now, all access via The Wikipedia Library "
"required that you apply to and be approved for individual collections. The "
"Library Bundle changes that workflow by making some collections immediately "
"available to everyone who meets the experience requirements outlined in our "
"Terms of Use. As long as you continue to meet those requirements (which "
"include 10 edits within the past month and not being blocked), you will have "
"on-demand access to Library Bundle collections via the Library Card without "
"needing to make an application or renewal request.</p> <p>You can verify "
"whether you meet the criteria to access Library Bundle collections on the "
"Library Card homepage - https://wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org. If you are "
"eligible, collections will be accessible via the 'Instant Access' tab of My "
"Library.</p> <p>You may notice when accessing resources via EZProxy that "
"URLs are dynamically rewritten. Note that use of EZProxy requires you to "
"enable cookies. If you are having problems you should also try clearing your "
"cache and restarting your browser. Please be aware that existing individual "
"logins for EZProxy-enabled collections (including the Library Bundle) will "
"soon be deactivated, so this will be your only means of access for these "
"collections. Any collections in the ‘Individual access’ tab in My Library "
"will function as before.</p> <p>Along with the launch of these new access "
