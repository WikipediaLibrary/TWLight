"""
Commonly needed custom view mixins.

Note that these do *not* use something like django-braces' UserPassesTestMixin,
because we may need to use multiple tests in one view (e.g. must be a
coordinator AND must have agreed to the terms of use). If we used that mixin,
test functions and login URLs would overwrite each other. Using the dispatch
function and super() means we can chain as many access tests as we'd like.
